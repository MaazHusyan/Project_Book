# Robotics Book Constitution

## Core Principles

### P1: Primacy of Human Knowledge
The accumulation and transmission of human knowledge, scientific principles, and technical expertise represents the most valuable asset for advancing robotics. All AI assistance must complement, not replace, human expertise and validation.

### P2: Progressive Complexity
Robotics knowledge should be structured from fundamental principles to advanced applications, enabling learners to build understanding incrementally while maintaining clarity at each level.

### P3: Practical Application
Theory must be consistently connected to real-world implementation, with code examples, case studies, and hands-on projects that demonstrate practical value.

### P4: Ethical Development
All robotics development must consider safety, accessibility, and societal impact, ensuring that technological advancement benefits all humanity.

### P5: Continuous Improvement
Documentation and implementations must be regularly updated to reflect the latest research, industry practices, and community feedback.
